inclusive_growth_md_recidivism_analysis
Data driven solutions to reduce recidivism and promote financial inclusion in under-served Maryland communities using Mastercard's Inclusive Growth Score
## 🧠Project Summary 
Recidivism in Baltimore isn't about unwillingness to change - it's about structural financial exclusion.
Our project uses Mastercard's Inclusive Growth Score (IGS) and public data to map systemic disparities between Baltimore City and Montgomery County. We propose the ARC Foundation, a place-based reentry program powered by prepaid Mastercard technology, compliance-based housing, and employment incentives.
The goal? Reduce recidivism by 10%, generate $17M+ in state savings, and drive inclusive financial opportunity across under-served Maryland communities
