Data driven solutions to reduce recidivism and promote financial inclusion in under-served Maryland communities using Mastercard's Inclusive Growth Score
## 🧠 Project Summary 
Recidivism in Baltimore isn't about unwillingness to change - it's about structural financial exclusion
Our project uses Mastercard's Inclusive Growth Score (IGS) and public data to map systemic disparities between Baltimore City and Montgomery County. We propose the ARC Foundation, a place-based reentry program powered by prepaid Mastercard technology, compliance-based housing, and employment incentives
The goal? Reduce recidivism by 10%, generate $17M+ in state savings, and drive inclusive financial opportunity across under-served Maryland communities
## 📍 Problem Focus
Baltimore neighborhoods score < 45 on the IGS - signaling disinvestment in Baltimore City.
High poverty, unemployment, and incarceration rates persist
1 in 3 Baltimore residents has a criminal record, excluding them from housing and jobs 
We asked: What if reentry was treated as a financial equity problem, not a criminal one? 
## 🛠️  Methodology 
1. **Cluster Selection** - We analyzed zip-code clusters from: Baltimore City (Penn North, Park Heights) and Montgomery County (Bethesda, North Potomac)
2. **Data Collection & Cleaning** - Inclusive Growth Score Platform (required dataset) , BLS, Census, DPSCS, HUD, Excel + Python used for data transformation
3. **AWS Integration** - S3: Hosted data and slide deck for public access, Athena: Queried cluster-level disparities, QuickSight: Visualized economic and incarceration patterns
4. **Equity Framing** - Our analysis centered race, place, and access - not just raw numbers - to drive human-centered insights
## 💡 Our Solution: OpenLine Reentry Account
Reentry isn't a dead end - it's an OpenLine.

**Pilot Program Features:** 

1. Mastercard reloadable card (authorized purchases only)
2. Mandatory employment, drug-free, compliance, and housing engagement
